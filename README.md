# SAMPL5-HostGuest-Metrics
To compute uncertainties, change directory to the Calc-OA or Calc-CB subdirectories and execute the Run.tcsh script.  A series of .dat files are created which contain the error metrics.  For each error metric, three numbers are produced: 1) the raw error metric (without resampling), 2) the mean of the resampled error metric, and 3) the SEM of the resampled error metric.
